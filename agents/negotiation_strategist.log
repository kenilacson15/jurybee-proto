2025-05-16 00:00:55,683 - ERROR - [NegotiationStrategist] - Parsing/validation failed: Invalid json output: This clause, "The party agrees to non-disclosure of proprietary information," is far too vague and carries a high risk of being unenforceable or insufficient to protect the disclosing party.  The high risk level and 0.85 confidence are justified.  Here's a breakdown of the problems and how to improve it:

**Problems:**

* **Lack of Definition of "Proprietary Information":**  What constitutes "proprietary information"?  This needs a precise definition, including examples (e.g., customer lists, financial data, source code, marketing strategies, research and development data, etc.).  Without a clear definition, the clause is ambiguous and difficult to enforce.  A court may struggle to determine what information is actually covered.

* **Lack of Specificity Regarding the Scope of Non-Disclosure:**  The clause doesn't specify the duration of the non-disclosure obligation, the permitted uses of the information, or the individuals or entities bound by the obligation.  Is it perpetual?  Are there exceptions for public disclosure or information already in the public domain?

* **Lack of Remedies for Breach:** What happens if the NDA is breached?  The clause needs to specify remedies, such as injunctive relief (court order to stop disclosure), monetary damages (compensatory and potentially punitive), and attorney's fees.

* **Lack of Geographic Scope:** Where does the obligation apply?  Is it limited to a specific jurisdiction or globally?


**Improved Clause Suggestions:**

Here are several options for improved clauses, each addressing the identified weaknesses:

**Option 1 (Concise):**

"Recipient agrees to maintain the confidentiality of Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information, defined as all confidential and proprietary information disclosed by Disclosing Party to Recipient, including but not limited to [list specific examples, e.g., customer lists, financial data, source code, etc.], for a period of [Number] years from the date of disclosure.  Recipient shall not disclose or use Proprietary Information except as expressly permitted in writing by Disclosing Party.  Breach of this confidentiality obligation shall entitle Disclosing Party to injunctive relief, monetary damages, and attorney's fees."


**Option 2 (More Detailed):**

"Recipient agrees to maintain the confidentiality of Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information, defined as all confidential and proprietary information disclosed by Disclosing Party to Recipient, whether orally, visually, or in writing, including but not limited to [list specific examples, e.g., customer lists, financial data, source code, trade secrets, marketing plans, business strategies, etc.]. This includes information that is designated as confidential or proprietary by Disclosing Party, or that, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, ought reasonably to be treated as confidential. This obligation shall continue for [Number] years from the date of disclosure and shall survive the termination of any agreement between the parties. Recipient shall not disclose or use Proprietary Information for any purpose other than the specific purpose(s) for which it was disclosed, as set forth in [Agreement Name/Reference].  Recipient shall protect Proprietary Information using the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care.  Any breach of this confidentiality obligation shall entitle Disclosing Party to injunctive relief, monetary damages (including but not limited to lost profits and consequential damages), and attorney's fees."


**Next Steps:**

1. **Define "Proprietary Information" exhaustively:**  The list of examples should be comprehensive and tailored to the specific information being protected.
2. **Specify the Duration:**  Determine an appropriate timeframe for the confidentiality obligation.
3. **Define Permitted Uses:**  Clearly state what the recipient is allowed to do with the proprietary information.
4. **Include Remedies:**  Specify the consequences of a breach.
5. **Consider Geographic Scope:**  Specify the geographical area where the NDA applies.
6. **Consult Legal Counsel:**  It is crucial to have a lawyer review and finalize the NDA to ensure it complies with applicable laws and effectively protects your interests.


By addressing these weaknesses, the risk level can be significantly reduced.  The revised clause should provide much stronger protection for the disclosing party's proprietary information.
